        <h3>Website development, "JonasXP"</h3>
        <p>
          The website you're reading this on right now was developed solely by
          me as a show of skills and as portfolio management.
        </p>
        <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul className="cv-list">
          <li>
            Concept development of both the entire site and individual
            "applications"
          </li>
          <li>
            Coding both site and individual applications from ground-up
            (ReactJS, .js, .tsx)
          </li>
          <li>
            Modular design (easily allowing for future "app installations")
          </li>
          <li>Implementation of numerous node packages such as a pdf-reader</li>
          <li>Continuous deployment using Git</li>
          <li>Domain and deployment of site (using Netlify)</li>
          <li>Integrating e-mail service to allow contact via website</li>
          <li>
            Securely storing API keys using server-side functions and
            environment variables
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you're interested in the technical structure of this site or
          further details on its development, I highly recommend you check out
